# System Admins

### Responsibility
* The System Admins for each of the systems DVELP uses are defined in the below
table. It is the responsibility of the System Admin to make sure that only the relevant
people have access to these systems and at the right permission level.

### Principle of Least Privilege
* We operate on the principle of least privilege, which means individuals should have
the minimum level of privilege in order to be able to perform their role
effectively.

### Monthly review
* System Admins conduct a thorough review of the permissions once every calendar
month and adjust permissions ad hoc whenever required due to a person
joining/leaving the team and/or a project starting/ending.

### Deputy System Admins
* Deputy System Admins are required to have admin permissions on the relevant
platforms. This is to enable them to handle urgent requests while System Admins
are absent. Deputy System Admins are not required to conduct the thorough
monthly review.
